# Final serving measurements (historical)

Generated from the linked raw receipts by `scripts/summarize-results.py`.

> **Historical record: pre-rebase v0.1.0–v0.3.1 images, 400 W RTX, 262144
> context.** Current v0.31.0 / 600 W measurements:
> [../docs/performance-comparison.md](../docs/performance-comparison.md) and
> [../docs/quality-comparison.md](../docs/quality-comparison.md).

RTX profiles run on one RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell 96 GB at a 400 W power limit. The Spark profile, when present, runs on one DGX Spark GB10 with unified memory. C1 is the default-selection priority. All use FP8 KV and host token embeddings. The mmap profiles read PLE rows from checkpoint-backed mappings; the original RTX profiles retain resident host tables. All decode rates below exclude prefill.

EXL3 and NVFP4 columns retain the v0.1.0 measurements; only the mmap-enabled EXL3 PLE8 column records its v0.2.0 qualification. The RTX EXL3 baseline has a different PLE storage precision, so this is not a controlled mmap-on/off comparison. The mmap run uses existing Linux page cache and benchmark warmups; it is not a cold-disk or constrained-RAM test.

The Spark column is newly qualified on native arm64 with the original BF16 PLE checkpoint.

## Profiles

| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Independent Spark suites ran on four hosts with identical image IDs, serving arguments and selected environment settings. Each measurement uses one TP=1 GB10. Dynamically profiled KV allocations and page-cache histories can differ between hosts. [Host assignments, runtime receipts and memory snapshots](spark-final/qualification-manifest.json).

## Seven content workloads: C1

One warmup and three measured responses per workload, temperature zero and thinking disabled. Values are median tokens/s (minimum–maximum). The weighted blend is total post-initial-burst tokens divided by their total decode time. Rates include failed output contracts and are not successful-task throughput.

The code contract checks syntax and required assertions; it does not execute the generated code. The Chinese terminology check is a literal-phrase proxy and can reject a correct paraphrase. All rejected responses remain in the raw files.

## Orchid repetition: C1

The prompt requests exactly 100 space-separated `orchid` words, with a 1500-token output cap. One warmup precedes five measured runs. Counts and contract failures are retained; a fast incorrect repetition is not a task success.

## Sampled prose: independent clients

Each client requests 256 forced output tokens at temperature 0.7 with fixed sampling seeds and thinking disabled. Two full warmups and three measurements per concurrency. Aggregate rate divides the sum of each client's N−1 tokens by the whole batch's first-to-last token window. Overlap counts come from client stream intervals, not a GPU occupancy gauge.

## Prefill matrix: C1

Exact prompt lengths, unique first cache blocks and three measurements after a warmup at each depth. Effective prompt tokens/s includes server tokenization and the handoff of the first output token; it is not isolated GPU prefill time.

## Context and decode scaling: C1

Synthetic filler followed by 256 forced output tokens. One warmup and three measurements at each depth; median (minimum–maximum). This measures serving capacity and speed, not long-context reasoning quality.

## Reference coding task: C1 across KV depths

The async task-runner prompt is identical to the reference recipe. Qwen's native non-thinking template replaces GLM's template. Temperature is 0.2, with a fixed seed and 256 forced output tokens. One warmup precedes three measurements per depth. Prompts repeat to retain existing KV; these TTFTs are not uncached prefill measurements. Rates use the reference's N−1 token convention; raw receipts also retain the rate excluding the whole initial SSE burst. The fixed token cap is not a generated-code correctness test.

EXL3 mmap Spark (BF16 PLE) evaluator-flagged cases:

- TC-42 (Extra Parameter Injection): Injected extra parameters despite additionalProperties: false.

API checks cover required/named/auto/none choices, thinking on/off and streaming/non-streaming. Retrieval places a random key early, midway and late in 8192- and 240000-token filler archives. Image checks read ordered numbers from 1, 4 and 16 images; they are smoke tests, not broad vision evaluation.

Tool-eval-bench is pinned at `cf54b4bfe705f12f71e8866f10730572497c8105`. Results are earned/possible points from a C8 run (eight concurrent cases), not a normalized score for comparison with other execution setups. The full 88-case suite includes 19 Hard Mode scenarios, with thinking enabled, temperature zero, one trial, eight parallel cases and at most eight turns. The linked reports retain failures and partial scores.

Spark API and C8 tool results above use the corrected structured-output image. All 14 structured-output regressions and 29 complete JSON/reasoning/EOS canaries pass, with no XGrammar FSM errors in the corrected server logs. [Corrected qualification and runtime](spark-structured-final/qualification.json). Performance, vision, retrieval and boundary receipts retain the original qualified image; the corrected image preserves every original filesystem layer and adds only the structured-output backports and their tests. [Earlier tool run](spark-final/tools.md).

## mmap memory snapshot

Captured after the performance/retrieval suite, before the full tool evaluation. These are process mapping observations, not a working-set ceiling or a low-RAM test. Linux can retain and reclaim clean checkpoint pages as workloads change.

The backing filesystem is ext4 on a Samsung 9100 PRO 4TB NVMe. PREWARM, READAHEAD and PINNED are off; the run uses the existing file cache and the warmups specified above. [Full memory and storage receipt](exl3-ple8-mmap-final/memory.json).

## Spark BF16 PLE memory snapshot

Spark uses unified CPU/GPU memory with GPU memory utilization capped at 0.7. Mapped checkpoint pages are reclaimable file cache; their resident size is a snapshot, not a fixed working-set limit. The BF16 PLE table is approximately 95.37 GiB on disk.
