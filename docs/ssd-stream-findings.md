# P2 pre-work findings (streaming PLE from NVMe)

Analysis only. Nothing in the P2 plan has been executed. These are measurements
taken on `burst` and `gg` on 2026-10-10/11 while re-deriving the assumptions in
`.opencode/plan/2026-10-11-ssd-ple-streaming.md`. Three of them are wrong, and
one of the three removes most of P2's stated motivation.

Reproduce any of it with the snippets in the appendix; every number below is a
measurement on this hardware, not a citation.

## 1. The pinned-memory ceiling is PyTorch power-of-two rounding, not a kernel limit

**This is the load-bearing finding.** The plan's section 5 records a ceiling it
could not explain: "64 GiB single pinned allocation succeeds, 70 GiB fails",
with cgroups, `RLIMIT_MEMLOCK` and `CommitLimit` all eliminated and the
mechanism left "unidentified". `platform-config.sh:150-229` then encodes an
empirical 55%-of-installed-RAM refusal bracket derived from that bracketing.

The mechanism is in `ATen/core/CachingHostAllocator.h`:

```cpp
// Round up the allocation to the nearest power of two to improve reuse.
// These power of two sizes are also used to index into the free list.
const auto roundSize = [&]() -> size_t {
  if (size <= pinned_max_round_threshold() &&
      size <= pinned_max_cached_size()) {
    return c10::llvm::PowerOf2Ceil(size);
  } else {
    return size;
  }
}();
```

Both thresholds default to `std::numeric_limits<size_t>::max()`
(`c10/core/AllocatorConfig.h:361,363`), so the rounding always applies.
Measured on torch 2.13.0+cu130 (the v0.31.0 image):

| requested (pinned) | actually mapped |
| --- | --- |
| 3 MiB | 4 MiB |
| 5 MiB | 8 MiB |
| 9 MiB | 16 MiB |
| 300 MiB | 512 MiB |
| 1.5 GiB | 2 GiB |
| 5 GiB | 8 GiB |

Worst case approaches 2x; the table sizes land at 1.34x.

### It reproduces every unexplained number in the plan

| claim | plan's figure | next_pow2 explains it |
| --- | --- | --- |
| gg FP8 host commitment | "system Shmem 66.18 GiB against 48.87 GiB derived" | 47.684 -> 64 GiB, + 1.184 -> 2 GiB = **66.0** |
| burst live worker | `RssShmem` 130.28 GiB | 95.367 -> **128 GiB**, + 2 GiB = **130.0** |
| "64 GiB pins, 70 GiB fails" on a 125.68 GiB host | unexplained | 64 -> 64 fits; 70 -> **128 GiB**, larger than RAM |
| "1.35x the derived figure" in the memcheck warning | empirical fudge | exactly `128/95.367 = 1.342` |

Direct evidence from the live `exl3` worker on burst (`/proc/143540/smaps`):

```
128.000 GiB  rss=128.000 GiB  pow2=True  /dev/zero (deleted)   <- PLE table, needs 95.367
  2.000 GiB  rss=  2.000 GiB  pow2=True  /dev/zero (deleted)   <- token embed, needs 1.184
```

So `exl3` (BF16) does not fail on `gg` because 95.4 GiB of pinned memory is too
much for a 125.68 GiB host. It fails because 95.367 GiB rounds to 128 GiB,
which is larger than the machine. The 55% bracket in `qwen38_ple_memcheck()` is
a coincidence of that rounding boundary, and it will mis-refuse on any host
whose RAM is not near a power of two.

### The workaround is verified and needs no engine change

`cudaHostAlloc` bypasses the caching host allocator and does not round:

```
cudaHostAlloc(  5.000 GiB) -> maps   5.008 GiB   EXACT   (pin_memory:  8.00 GiB)
cudaHostAlloc( 47.684 GiB) -> maps  47.692 GiB   EXACT   (pin_memory: 64.00 GiB)
cudaHostAlloc( 95.367 GiB) -> maps  95.375 GiB   EXACT   (pin_memory:128.00 GiB)
```

Power-of-two tiling inside torch works too, because the free list is indexed by
pow2 sizes, so a tile that is already a power of two is not grown:

```
FP8 table as ONE 47.684 GiB    committed 64.008 GiB   waste 34.2%
FP8 table TILED  32+15.684     committed 48.000 GiB   waste  0.7%
BF16 table as ONE 95.367 GiB   committed 128.000 GiB  waste 34.2%
BF16 table TILED  64+31.367    committed  96.00 GiB   waste ~0.7%
```

No `PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF` key controls this in torch 2.13: the parser accepts
only `backend`, `expandable_segments`, `garbage_collection_threshold` and
`roundup_power2_divisions` (the last one is for the device allocator; measured
to have no effect on pinning).

### Consequence for P2

`Qwen4ExpPLEPinnedHostEmbedding.allocate_embedding_weight()`
(`vllm/models/qwen4_exp/nvidia/ple.py:462`) is the single call site. Routing it
through `cudaHostAlloc` (or tiling) saves 32.6 GiB on FP8 and 32.6 GiB on BF16,
and it means:

* `exl3` BF16 needs 95.4 GiB, not 128 GiB. On a 125.68 GiB host that is a
  different problem entirely, and it is worth re-measuring before designing an
  I/O path around it.
* The plan's P2 value item "reclaiming ~48 GiB for KV cache on hosts that can
  run ple8" is largely available for free: ple8 commits 64 GiB where it needs
  47.7.
* The `qwen38_ple_memcheck()` 55% bracket should be replaced by
  `next_pow2(table) + next_pow2(embed)` versus installed RAM, which is the
  quantity the allocator actually requests.

Caveat: unverified on `gg`, which is `exl3-ple8`-serving right now and cannot be
disturbed. The prediction is that a `cudaHostAlloc` of 47.684 GiB succeeds there
where `pin_memory` of the same size is at the edge. Confirm on `burst` first.
