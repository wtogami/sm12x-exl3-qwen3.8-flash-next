# Qwen3.8 Flash Next on RTX PRO 6000 and DGX Spark

A TP=1 SM12x serving recipe with host-resident token embeddings and
mmap-backed (checkpoint-mapped) PLE n-gram tables, FP8 KV cache, vision, CUDA
graphs, and tuned MTP. The configured context is 262144 tokens and the
scheduler has 16 request slots. C1 performance is the priority for the
defaults; C16 throughput tradeoffs are recorded below.

> **Rebased to vLLM v0.30.0 (unreleased).** The runtime now builds on the

> published images; the latest tag, `v0.31.0rc1`, has no published image yet.
> The model ships upstream as `vllm/models/qwen4_exp` (Qwen4Exp is the
> upstream codename for Qwen3.8-Flash-Next; the pinned checkpoints declare
> `model_type: qwen4_exp`), so this recipe no longer needs a custom vLLM base.
> Several former ports are now upstream code and were dropped, FP8 QSA comes

| Profile (`QUANT`) | Checkpoint | PLE table format | Default MTP (RTX / Spark) |
|---|---|---|---:|
| `exl3` | [EXL3 K4.25](https://huggingface.co/wrldsuksgo2mars/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-EXL3-K4.25-v1) | BF16, about 95 GiB | 3 / 2 |
| `exl3-ple8` | [EXL3 K4.25 PLE FP8](https://huggingface.co/wrldsuksgo2mars/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-EXL3-K4.25-PLE-FP8-v1) | FP8 with shared scale, about 48 GiB | 3 / 2 |
| `nvfp4` | [NVIDIA NVFP4](https://huggingface.co/nvidia/Qwen3.8-Flash-Next-NVFP4) | FP8 with shared scale, about 48 GiB | 2 / 2 |

EXL3 requires independent K4/K5 allocation for each expert's gate, up and down
projection. The pinned B12x fork supports this geometry and preserves all 5951
experts with unequal projection tiers across target and MTP layers. The
`exl3-ple8` profile keeps those expert weights and uses NVIDIA's FP8 PLE table.
The shipping default is **`exl3` with mmap enabled**, retaining the original
BF16 PLE table. Choose `exl3-ple8` to save about 47.7 GiB of checkpoint payload,
reduce download/storage requirements, or fit more PLE rows in the available
file cache on a lower-RAM system. Its FP8 PLE table is approximately half the
size of the BF16 table. The existing RTX measurements do not include a new
BF16 mmap default run.

The `exl3-ple8` profile now has a full benchmark matrix with **mmap enabled**
in v0.2.0, including the quality checks in the main tables below.
The original EXL3/NVIDIA performance columns below are unchanged historical
results, not new runs. They differ in quantization and PLE precision from the
mmap profile; this is not a controlled mmap-on/off comparison.

Selected-profile results: RTX columns use one 400 W card; Spark uses one GB10.

| Measurement | EXL3 resident, MTP3 (v0.1.0) | NVFP4 resident, MTP2 (v0.1.0) | EXL3 PLE8 mmap, MTP3 | EXL3 mmap Spark (BF16 PLE), MTP2 |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| C1 seven-workload weighted decode, tokens/s | **152.82** | **151.11** | **147.78** | **31.11** |
| C1 greedy `merge_intervals` median, tokens/s | 202.99 | 185.55 | 197.74 | 38.12 |
| C1 sampled async coding task median, tokens/s | 185.55 | 166.92 | 183.45 | 36.21 |
| C16 sampled-prose aggregate median, tokens/s | 696.96 | 930.71 | 659.75 | 101.00 |
| Full-context boundary: 261888 input + 256 output | Pass | Pass | Pass | Pass |
| API tool constraints / retrieval probes | 16/16; 6/6 | 16/16; 6/6 | 16/16; 6/6 | 16/16; 6/6 |

These are different workloads, not interchangeable rates. The full matrices
below show medians, settings, contract failures and tool points. Linked raw
receipts retain individual measurements; the [detailed report](benchmarks/RESULTS.md)
also includes measurement ranges. Tool evaluation uses C8 (eight concurrent cases);
its points are not presented as a normalized comparison score.

## Platforms

`bash build.sh` and `bash start.sh` detect the host architecture automatically:
arm64 selects DGX Spark SM121 settings; x86_64 selects RTX SM120 settings.
Both default to the original EXL3 K4.25 checkpoint with BF16 PLE and mmap.
Spark caps GPU memory utilization at **0.7** to leave unified memory available
for checkpoint pages and the host. A lower value is configurable.

| Recipe default | RTX SM120 | Spark SM121 |
|---|---|---|
| Native architecture | x86_64 | arm64 |
| GPU memory utilization | 0.94 | 0.7 maximum |
| EXL3 MTP draft tokens | 3 | 2 |
| Vocabulary projection | Native | B12x |
| PLE storage | host-offloaded resident table | BF16 mmap checkpoint mapping |
| Maximum context / request slots | 262144 / 16 | 262144 / 16 |

Use `B12X_VOCAB=0` for the native vocabulary projection or
`B12X_VOCAB=1` to opt the RTX build in. `PLE_MMAP` overrides the platform
default on either host (`--engram-config` on the command line overrides the
launcher entirely).

Spark's original BF16 PLE default has completed the full qualification below.
The RTX columns retain their existing measurements.
[Release v0.3.1](https://github.com/tpurtell/sm12x-exl3-qwen3.8-flash-next/releases/tag/v0.3.1)
provides native images for both platforms, including the reviewed speculative
reasoning and xgrammar termination fixes, plus the resident-mode loading repair.
The v0.3.1 checks cover all 220 tests on RTX, the new resident regressions on
both architectures, and full-model resident/mmap checks on RTX. The earlier
v0.3.0 structured-output qualification remains linked below.
The [RTX shipping-default structured-output qualification](benchmarks/rtx-structured-final/qualification.json)
adds a C8 tool run without changing the historical RTX table columns.

## Run

Install Docker with NVIDIA GPU access. Build and run from the repository root;
the scripts select the native RTX or Spark defaults automatically:

```bash
bash build.sh
bash download.sh
bash start.sh
curl http://127.0.0.1:8001/health
```

To use the pinned image instead of building, replace `bash build.sh` with
`bash pull.sh`. It selects the native image and installs the same local tag
used by `start.sh`. Immutable image digests are recorded in
[platform-config.sh](platform-config.sh).

| Platform | Image package | Status |
|---|---|---|
| RTX, linux/amd64 | `ghcr.io/tpurtell/rtx6k-exl3-qwen3.8-flash-next` | v0.3.1 (pre-rebase) |
| Spark, linux/arm64 | `ghcr.io/tpurtell/spark-exl3-qwen3.8-flash-next` | v0.3.1 (pre-rebase) |

The published packages above predate the v0.30.0 rebase; `pull.sh` installs
them until rebased images are published. **Build with `build.sh` to get the
rebased runtime.** The Spark package currently requires registry
authentication while its visibility is private. The package owner can enable
public pulls in GitHub package settings.

The RTX measurements use one RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell 96 GB at **400 W**, driver
595.71.05, and a Threadripper 9970X host with 183 GiB CPU RAM. Spark uses a GB10
with approximately 121.63 GiB shared CPU/GPU memory and driver 580.159.03.
Each target/draft token embedding adds approximately 1.184 GiB of host storage
beyond the PLE table. Leave additional memory for model loading, the server
and the operating system; 95/48 GiB are table sizes, not whole-server memory
requirements. Checkpoint weights are downloaded separately.

```bash
# Stop before switching models to release the host tables.
bash stop.sh
QUANT=exl3-ple8 bash download.sh
QUANT=exl3-ple8 bash start.sh
# NVIDIA: use QUANT=nvfp4 for download.sh, start.sh and stop.sh.
# GPU=1 selects another GPU on a multi-GPU RTX host.
```

The OpenAI-compatible endpoint is `http://127.0.0.1:8001/v1`, with served
aliases `qwen38-exl3`, `qwen38-exl3-ple8` and `qwen38-nvfp4`. Tool calls use
`qwen3_coder`; reasoning uses `qwen3`. Send
`"chat_template_kwargs":{"enable_thinking":false}` for the non-thinking mode
used in performance tests. The full tool-quality suite uses thinking enabled.

`GPU`, `PORT`, `CONTAINER_NAME`, `HF_CACHE`, `RUNTIME_CACHE`, `CPU_THREADS`,
`MAX_MODEL_LEN`, `MAX_NUM_SEQS`, `MAX_BATCHED_TOKENS`,
`GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION`, `PLE_MMAP` and `MTP_TOKENS` can override the
defaults. `MTP_TOKENS=0` disables speculation. Runtime/compiler caches persist
under `~/.cache/qwen38-rtx/<profile>`; checkpoint caches are mounted
read-only. The launcher uses the native multiprocessing executor and passes
the PLE storage mode through `--engram-config`.

Sixteen scheduler slots do **not** mean sixteen simultaneous 262144-token
requests fit in the KV pool. The final tests include sixteen overlapping
short-context client streams and a separate exact full-context boundary test.
The KV pool is profiled at startup and can differ between hosts even with the
same memory-utilization setting; runtime receipts retain the actual capacity.
Measured startup KV pools were 796612 tokens for resident EXL3, 686817 for
resident NVIDIA and 880600 for EXL3 PLE8 mmap (3.04×, 2.62× and 3.36× the
configured context); actual scheduling also depends on
request mix. Use the context and concurrency tables below to distinguish those cases.

## Mmap PLE

`PLE_MMAP=1` selects the checkpoint-mapped PLE table
(`--engram-config '{"cpu_offload": true, "checkpoint_mapped": true}'`).
The lookup kernel reads rows in place from read-only mappings of the
checkpoint's safetensors shards; a model-runner input-prep pass issues
readahead for the rows a step needs. There is no table-sized device or pinned
allocation. This is the upstream redesign from merged-into-main PRs
[#58439](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/58439) and
[#58835](https://github.com/vllm-project/vllm/pull/58835) (stacked, at head
`47b9933db82d`), vendored and rebased onto v0.30.0 by this recipe.

**Platform support.** Direct checkpoint mapping requires a GPU that
dereferences pageable host memory through the host page tables
(`CU_DEVICE_ATTRIBUTE_PAGEABLE_MEMORY_ACCESS_USES_HOST_PAGE_TABLES`), which
the CUDA driver checks at startup. DGX Spark (GB10, unified memory) passes and
defaults to mmap. A discrete RTX PRO 6000 reports the attribute as 0 (measured
on driver 615.71.09), so the RTX default is `PLE_MMAP=0`: the upstream
host-offloaded resident table (`cpu_offload`, the same v0.1.0-era behavior as
the historical RTX benchmark rows). Setting `PLE_MMAP=1` on unsupported
hardware fails fast with the driver-reported attribute. Token embeddings
remain in host RAM in either mode. Mapped tables cover the checkpoint's
actual dtype: BF16 for `exl3`, FP8 E4M3 with its scalar scale for
`exl3-ple8` and `nvfp4`. The former per-knob `PLE_MMAP_*` environment
variables are gone; the prefetch/readahead tunables are internal upstream
defaults, and a custom `--engram-config` passed to `start.sh` overrides the
launcher's one entirely.

```bash
GPU=0 bash start.sh  # RTX default: exl3, host-offloaded BF16 PLE table
QUANT=exl3-ple8 GPU=0 bash start.sh  # FP8 PLE, smaller checkpoint/cache footprint
# Run one model at a time; use stop.sh with the same QUANT before switching.
# PLE_MMAP=1/0 overrides the platform default; Spark defaults to mmap.
```

The old PR #54129 gather-based backport and its B12x-era tuning knobs are
removed with the rebase; its review tests targeted code paths the upstream
redesign no longer has (streamed-scale comparison). The upstream test suite
`tests/test_ple_pageable.py` (594 checks at the PR head) is vendored for
GPU-equipped hosts. Mapped pages remain clean and reclaimable in the file
cache. Historical mmap snapshots below remain valid observations of the
pre-rebase runtime.

Mapped pages may accumulate in Linux's file cache, but remain clean and
reclaimable. An initial snapshot showed about 2.3 GiB resident across the
47.68 GiB table mappings, with no anonymous or dirty PLE mapping pages. This
is not a fixed memory limit. Benchmarks use an ext4 filesystem on a Samsung
9100 PRO 4TB NVMe, the existing OS page cache and explicit warmups; they do
not establish cold-disk throughput or a minimum host-RAM requirement.

## MTP tuning and C16 tradeoffs

These RTX v0.1.0 resident-mode development comparisons use the same seven C1 workloads (three measured
responses each). C8/C16 are shorter probes: 128 forced prose tokens, one measured
batch after warmup. They are distinct from the final 256-token, three-run client
matrix below. Small differences between runs are not a statistical proof of
superiority; defaults use the best observed mixed C1 result.

| Quant | Draft policy | C1 weighted blend, tokens/s | C8 aggregate | C16 aggregate |
|---|---|---:|---:|---:|
| EXL3 | Off | 92.76 | 465.99 | 762.88 |
| EXL3 | 1 | 131.54 | 561.14 | 861.92 |
| EXL3 | 2 | 149.16 | 532.52 | 718.39 |
| EXL3 | **3, default** | **152.97** | — | — |
| EXL3 | 4 | 150.63 | 408.90 | 486.12 |
| EXL3 | Adaptive 3 → 1 | 150.71 | 516.51 | 792.07 |
| NVFP4 | Off | 96.38 | 500.96 | 855.50 |
| NVFP4 | 1 | 130.35 | 597.43 | 915.16 |
| NVFP4 | **2, default** | **152.40** | 552.95 | 881.49 |
| NVFP4 | 3 | 149.46 | 549.68 | 544.11 |
| NVFP4 | Adaptive 2 → 1 | 146.04 | 585.89 | 858.97 |

Adaptive policies use the longer draft for 1–4 scheduled requests and one draft
token for 5–16. Neither improved the observed C1 blend. MTP1 is a measured option
for higher C16 throughput at a substantial C1 cost. The MTP4 EXL3 and MTP3 NVIDIA
C16 probes reached only 14 and 13 overlapping streams, respectively.

To reproduce the EXL3 adaptive comparison, suppress the automatic static
configuration and supply the measured scheduler policy explicitly:

```bash
QUANT=exl3 PLE_MMAP=0 MTP_TOKENS=0 bash start.sh --speculative-config \
  '{"method":"mtp","num_speculative_tokens":3,"num_speculative_tokens_per_batch_size":[[1,4,3],[5,16,1]]}'
```

For code-heavy C1 traffic, EXL3 MTP4 reached 217.18 tokens/s on the greedy
`merge_intervals` workload, versus 202.99 in the qualified MTP3 run. NVIDIA
MTP3 reached 202.67 versus 182.82 with MTP2. These are workload-specific options:
set `MTP_TOKENS=4` or `3` respectively. They are not the separate sampled async
coding task reported below. Full tuning receipts and exceptions are in the
[qualification ledger](docs/qualification.md) and [raw benchmarks](benchmarks).

Spark's BF16 mmap comparisons favor **MTP2** for the mixed C1 workload.
The initial readahead-off sweep measured 26.29, 27.32, 25.72 and 24.14 tokens/s
for MTP1 through MTP4. Targeted readahead raised the MTP2 blend to 29.21;
adding B12x vocabulary on the same host raised it to 30.75. The combined
MTP2 / readahead2048 / B12x vocabulary profile measures **31.11 tokens/s**
in the completed qualification.
[All Spark tuning receipts](benchmarks/spark-review/TUNING.md) retain the
C16 probes and same-host comparisons. The 128-range and 2048-range short
C16 probes measured 89.09 and 97.14 tokens/s; these single probes are distinct
from the final client matrix.

## Kernel choices

- **EXL3 mixed MoE:** B12x, including the Qwen H2560/I640 projection planner fix
  pushed to the [fork](https://github.com/tpurtell/sparkinfer-glmrt/commit/c76a40ee684cb3ef7d2c223d56a9b9cff25a3a1e).
- **QSA attention:** native upstream Triton QSA with the merged FP8 main-KV-cache
  support (PR 55557, vendored for v0.30.0). The FP8 cache is dequantized inside
  the QSA kernel with the layer's host-side scales; the indexer side caches and
  GDN state are unchanged. The former B12x QSA bridge is retired because v0.30.0
  rejects FP8 main caches and the merged upstream change supersedes the bridge;
  its pre-rebase measurements remain historical.
- **NVIDIA MoE:** native FlashInfer CUTLASS. Precise B12x won isolated component
  timings but lost the end-to-end C1 blend, 136.74 versus 152.40 tokens/s.
  `B12X_NVFP4=1` retains the tested optional bridge; it is off by default.
- **Vocabulary projection:** native on RTX; B12x on Spark. B12x did not improve
  the RTX mixed C1 blend, but improved the same-host Spark comparison from
  29.21 to 30.75 tokens/s. `B12X_VOCAB` overrides the platform default.
- **HC and GDN:** native on both platforms. Spark's native HC was faster at
  decode sizes; the optional B12x GDN path failed its B16/Q3 numerical check
  and showed no timing advantage in the earlier cases. RTX comparisons also
  retained native paths. Reproducers and failures remain in the repository.

The [Dockerfile](Dockerfile) pins the base image and B12x revision. The
[patches](patches) now carry the EXL3 namespace/MTP-mapping loader port, the
qflashrt FP8-PLE annotation for EXL3 hybrids, exact host token embeddings, the
optional B12x vocabulary projection and NVFP4 expert bridges, plus two
strict-hash vendored upstream backports (QSA FP8 main cache, PR 55557;
checkpoint-mapped PLE, PRs 58439+58835). The former MTP remap, FP8 draft
weights, ModelOpt PLE selection and structured-output ports are upstream code
in v0.30.0 and were dropped.
[Provenance](PROVENANCE.md) distinguishes borrowed benchmark contracts from new
integration work. Model licenses apply separately from the recipe's [license](LICENSE).

The v0.1.0 runtime receipts retain the original image IDs. The follow-on
v0.2.0 release adds mmap support and its reviewed validation fixes, with full
`exl3-ple8` mmap qualification on RTX. This branch adds native Spark support
and qualification of the original BF16 PLE default. Historical RTX evidence
is retained.

## Reproduce qualification

Run against an otherwise idle endpoint. These scripts refuse to overwrite an
existing result directory.

```bash
# With the mmap-enabled exl3-ple8 server already running:
QUANT=exl3-ple8 MTP_TOKENS=3 RESULT_DIR=benchmarks/my-mmap \
  bash scripts/benchmark-suite.sh
# Spark default: QUANT=exl3 MTP_TOKENS=2, with a new result directory.
# NVIDIA: QUANT=nvfp4 MTP_TOKENS=2, with its endpoint and a new result directory.

# Install tool-eval-bench at the recorded revision, using its uv environment.
# TOOL_EVAL_DIR points to that checkout; results also persist in its SQLite DB.
TOOL_EVAL_DIR=/path/to/tool-eval-bench RESULT_DIR=benchmarks/my-mmap \
  MODEL=qwen38-exl3-ple8 bash scripts/tool-quality.sh
```

Tool-eval-bench is pinned at `cf54b4bfe705f12f71e8866f10730572497c8105`.
The complete reports preserve failed and partial cases. Vision and retrieval
are targeted checks, not broad capability benchmarks. Exact orchid repetition
is unreliable, and throughput figures include outputs that fail contracts.


## Final serving measurements

Generated from the linked raw receipts by `scripts/summarize-results.py`.

RTX profiles run on one RTX PRO 6000 Blackwell 96 GB at a 400 W power limit. The Spark profile, when present, runs on one DGX Spark GB10 with unified memory. C1 is the default-selection priority. All use FP8 KV and host token embeddings. The mmap profiles read PLE rows from checkpoint-backed mappings; the original RTX profiles retain resident host tables. All decode rates below exclude prefill.

EXL3 and NVFP4 columns retain the v0.1.0 measurements; only the mmap-enabled EXL3 PLE8 column records its v0.2.0 qualification. The RTX EXL3 baseline has a different PLE storage precision, so this is not a controlled mmap-on/off ablation. The mmap run uses existing Linux page cache and benchmark warmups; it is not a cold-disk or constrained-RAM test.

The Spark column is newly qualified on native arm64 with the original BF16 PLE checkpoint.

## Profiles

| Profile | MTP draft tokens | GPU memory fraction | PLE storage | Serial threshold | Readahead range limit | Configuration |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EXL3 | 3 | 0.94 | resident | — | — | [runtime](benchmarks/exl3-final/runtime.json) |
| NVFP4 | 2 | 0.94 | resident | — | — | [runtime](benchmarks/nvfp4-final/runtime.json) |
| EXL3 PLE8 mmap | 3 | 0.94 | mmap | 128 | 0 | [runtime](benchmarks/exl3-ple8-mmap-final/runtime.json) |
| EXL3 mmap Spark (BF16 PLE) | 2 | 0.7 | mmap | 128 | 2048 | [runtime](benchmarks/spark-final/runtime.json) |

Independent Spark suites ran on four hosts with identical image IDs, serving arguments and selected environment settings. Each measurement uses one TP=1 GB10. Dynamically profiled KV allocations and page-cache histories can differ between hosts. [Host assignments, runtime receipts and memory snapshots](benchmarks/spark-final/qualification-manifest.json).

## Seven content workloads: C1

One warmup and three measured responses per workload, temperature zero and thinking disabled. Values are median tokens/s. The weighted blend is total post-initial-burst tokens divided by their total decode time. Rates include failed output contracts and are not successful-task throughput.

| Workload | EXL3 tokens/s | Contract | NVFP4 tokens/s | Contract | EXL3 PLE8 mmap tokens/s | Contract | EXL3 mmap Spark (BF16 PLE) tokens/s | Contract |

| EXL3 | 152.82 | 56.05% | 2.681 | [responses and timings](benchmarks/exl3-final/seven.jsonl) |

| EXL3 mmap Spark (BF16 PLE) | 31.11 | 62.96% | 2.259 | [responses and timings](benchmarks/spark-final/seven.jsonl) |

The code contract checks syntax and required assertions; it does not execute the generated code. The Chinese terminology check is a literal-phrase proxy and can reject a correct paraphrase. All rejected responses remain in the raw files.

## Orchid repetition: C1

The prompt requests exactly 100 space-separated `orchid` words, with a 1500-token output cap. One warmup precedes five measured runs. Counts and contract failures are retained; a fast incorrect repetition is not a task success.

| Quant | Word counts | Exact contract | Decode tokens/s | Raw |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| EXL3 | 750, 750, 101, 100, 102 | 1/5 | 236.03 | [responses](benchmarks/exl3-final/orchid.jsonl) |
| NVFP4 | 102, 101, 101, 100, 101 | 1/5 | 197.95 | [responses](benchmarks/nvfp4-final/orchid.jsonl) |
| EXL3 PLE8 mmap | 100, 101, 100, 750, 750 | 2/5 | 231.43 | [responses](benchmarks/exl3-ple8-mmap-final/orchid.jsonl) |
| EXL3 mmap Spark (BF16 PLE) | 750, 100, 100, 100, 102 | 3/5 | 41.84 | [responses](benchmarks/spark-final/orchid.jsonl) |

## Sampled prose: independent clients

Each client requests 256 forced output tokens at temperature 0.7 with fixed sampling seeds and thinking disabled. Two full warmups and three measurements per concurrency. Aggregate rate divides the sum of each client's N−1 tokens by the whole batch's first-to-last token window. Overlap counts come from client stream intervals, not a GPU occupancy gauge.

## Prefill matrix: C1

Exact prompt lengths, unique first cache blocks and three measurements after a warmup at each depth. Effective prompt tokens/s includes server tokenization and the handoff of the first output token; it is not isolated GPU prefill time.

## Reference coding task: C1 across KV depths

The async task-runner prompt is identical to the reference recipe. Qwen's native non-thinking template replaces GLM's template. Temperature is 0.2, with a fixed seed and 256 forced output tokens. One warmup precedes three measurements per depth. Prompts repeat to retain existing KV; these TTFTs are not uncached prefill measurements. Rates use the reference's N−1 token convention; raw receipts also retain the rate excluding the whole initial SSE burst. The fixed token cap is not a generated-code correctness test.

EXL3 mmap Spark (BF16 PLE) evaluator-flagged cases:

- TC-42 (Extra Parameter Injection): Injected extra parameters despite additionalProperties: false.

API checks cover required/named/auto/none choices, thinking on/off and streaming/non-streaming. Retrieval places a random key early, midway and late in 8192- and 240000-token filler archives. Image checks read ordered numbers from 1, 4 and 16 images; they are smoke tests, not broad vision evaluation.

Tool-eval-bench is pinned at `cf54b4bfe705f12f71e8866f10730572497c8105`. Results are earned/possible points from a C8 run (eight concurrent cases), not a normalized score for comparison with other execution setups. The full 88-case suite includes 19 Hard Mode scenarios, with thinking enabled, temperature zero, one trial, eight parallel cases and at most eight turns. The linked reports retain failures and partial scores.

Spark API and C8 tool results above use the corrected structured-output image. All 14 structured-output regressions and 29 complete JSON/reasoning/EOS canaries pass, with no XGrammar FSM errors in the corrected server logs. [Corrected qualification and runtime](benchmarks/spark-structured-final/qualification.json). Performance, vision, retrieval and boundary receipts retain the original qualified image; the corrected image preserves every original filesystem layer and adds only the structured-output backports and their tests. [Earlier tool run](benchmarks/spark-final/tools.md).

## mmap memory snapshot

Captured after the performance/retrieval suite, before the full tool evaluation. These are process mapping observations, not a working-set ceiling or a low-RAM test. Linux can retain and reclaim clean checkpoint pages as workloads change.

The backing filesystem is ext4 on a Samsung 9100 PRO 4TB NVMe. PREWARM, READAHEAD and PINNED are off; the run uses the existing file cache and the warmups specified above. [Full memory and storage receipt](benchmarks/exl3-ple8-mmap-final/memory.json).

## Spark BF16 PLE memory snapshot

Spark uses unified CPU/GPU memory with GPU memory utilization capped at 0.7. Mapped checkpoint pages are reclaimable file cache; their resident size is a snapshot, not a fixed working-set limit. The BF16 PLE table is approximately 95.37 GiB on disk.
